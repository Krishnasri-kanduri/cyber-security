# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

This repository demonstrates a secure method for hiding data within images using steganography.  Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within other, seemingly innocuous data. In this project, we leverage the least significant bits (LSB) of image pixels to embed secret messages, making the hidden data imperceptible to the human eye.
